This section is for those that tried the standard full yaml in the respective directories and everything works, but want more ;)

Those that just want the basics code to modify might find it easier to use the non-modular yamls.

ðŸ‘‰ If you try this and run into problems, please revert to the known working non-modular YAMLs.
And if you believe the issue isnâ€™t just user error, please report back. ðŸ˜‰

---

```markdown
## ðŸš€ Installation

1. Copy the YAML for your device (e.g. `Muma.yaml`) into your **ESPHome** configuration.  
   - Keep your own `name:` and `friendly_name:` values.  

2. Install the firmware to your device.  

3. (Optional) Update the **settings** section of the YAML if you want to:  
   - Change the `imagemodel`  
   - Change the `startup_sound`  

4. The **clockbackground** can be set directly from **Home Assistant (HA)**.

After this, if there is a update, all you need to do is compile again.
```

```markdown
## ðŸš€ Running locally (optional)

If you want to run and edit the Modular files locally:
1. Create a directory in your esphome/ directory called "localtest" and copy core.yaml + display_pages.yaml there.
2. Create a directory inside localtest/ called "HW" and copy the hardware file for your device there (eg. ball_v2_hw.yaml)
3. change the packages in main yaml on the device to:

packages:
  core: !include localtest/core.yaml
  hw:   !include localtest/HW/ball_v2_hw.yaml

```
Changes:
---
### Modular v1.08
- **Changes**
  - Updated most devices for mipi spi display drivers

### Modular v1.07
- **Changes**
  - Updated most devices with Music Assistant support

### Modular v1.06
- **Changes**  
  - Fixed swipes didn't work when "handle swipes locally" switch was off, optimized timing
  - changed minor non-breaking spelling mistake

### Modular v1.05
- **Changes**  
  - Added Rolex clockface (wallpaper) for analog clock
  - Fixed Battery status not showing on analog clock and presence (if enabled)

### Modular v1.04
- **Changes**  
  - Added Analog clock (yeah i know, why not)
  - Added switch for doing swipe actions internally (for better first experience), turn off if using automations.
    hardcoded swipe functions: left & right change clock style, down toggle battery, up change wallpaper.
  - Added light sensors for all 5 rooms and changed so presence shows a red LED dot. if light is on in room color is filled.

### Modular v1.03
- **Changes**  
  -  added 2 more clocks, a presence sensor clock and a weather clock

### Modular v1.02
- **Changes**  
  -  added 4 binary sensors for screen swipes, these do nothing by themself but are available in HA for whatevery you desire.
  -  Example automation that changes clock type (left and right swipes), changes wallpaper (swipe up) and toggles battery status (swipe down) can be found in: /Under_Development/Home_Assistant_Automations/
  -  I did it this way so it's not a locked functionality and we can do whatever we want with the sensors.

### Modular core v1.01
- **Fixes**  
  - fixed timer widget, fixed clock screensaver so it doesn't go on when timer is running
  - fixed so it also doesnt show clock until api image timer is done.
- **Changes**  
  - changed font for default clock from 30 to 42, and date font from 18 to 22
  - changed timer widget to new design. and removed 1 font (more memory saving ;)
  - removed removed 1 font, saved memory
  - moved micro wake words to main and left only "okay nabu" in core, this gives a wider selection of mmw's without loading all

# 📂 Home Assistant Automations

> *Automations I use or experiment with. **Remember to change entity and device names to your own.***

---

1. `camera_snapshot.yaml` - Takes image from camera, resize and convert, then show on screen.

2. `now_playing.yaml` - Sends coverart to display, i use LMS but should work with MA too.

3. `request_and_response_show_on_dashboard.yaml` - Sends your question and answer to dashboard using a text helper. max 255. chars.

4. `response_light.yaml` — Sample automation to turn the little led on in the balls when the assistant is thinking (or responding if you wish) by rchiileea.

5. `shell_command.yaml` - Shell Comands for configuration.yaml, resize and convert images, needed for now_playing & camera_snapshot

6. `swipe_test.yaml` -  Automation using the "swipe" binary sensors of Modular v1.02

7. `switch_voiceassist.yaml` — Talk to `<assistant>` (dynamic voice-agent switching by voice)**
   Say things like “**talk to Jarvis**” or “**let me talk to Harley Quinn**,” and the automation will switch the assistant/pipeline on your voice satellite **on the fly**. It reads the available options from your `select` entity at runtime, so you **don’t have to edit the Automation** when you add or rename assistants.
